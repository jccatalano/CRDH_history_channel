The Kampilan Four bladesmiths head to a scrapyard to create their signature blade using only harvested metal and a coal forge. Challenges arise when some struggle to keep their fires burning, and ultimately two competitors are left standing. In the final round, the smiths must recreate a fearsome battle weapon, the Kampilan. Their weapons must survive brutal testing, and only one will pull through by a hair to claim the title of Forged in Fire Champion.
