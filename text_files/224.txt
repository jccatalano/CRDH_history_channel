The Falcata Four bladesmiths must create a blade out of high carbon steel while also forging the hammer they'll use to make it. After an extraordinary round of testing, only two move on to the final round where they'll have just five days to create a weapon known for its deadly prowess against armored soldiers--the Falcata. Will the blade's unique handle shape leave them open to a devastating blow, or will one smith be able to slice their way to the $10,000?
