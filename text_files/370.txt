Twisted Chopper Dee Snider from Twisted Sister drops by the shop to get a new "Sugar Bear" front end put on his Von Dutch chopper. Problem is, legendary bike builder and front end namesake "Sugar Bear" works at his own pace, and since Dee needs the bike in a hurry, Danny makes a road trip to LA to pick up the front end, and hang with his old friend Sugar while he's there. Back in Vegas, Ryan and Horny Mike go cruising, to try and find a new project for the shop.
