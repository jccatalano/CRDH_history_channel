Highly Explosive Pawn (Enhanced.) A seller approaches the Pawn Stars to present them with a past prop from "Back to the Future, Part II." Rick feels dated when a creepy chemical company calendar from 1900 crosses his desk. It's all hands on deck when a British Navy gunpowder bucket blasts into the shop. Will Rick scoop it up, or send it overboard? Later, a belt owned by country music legend Merle Haggard takes things up a notch.
