Oh Holy Pawn! Get holy with the Pawn Stars as Rick gets the chance to purchase a page from the Gutenberg Bible. Known as the first printed book, will the single page break Rick's bank or leave him wanting more? Then, Corey checks out a rare six-sheet movie poster from the classic "Ziegfeld Follies" that's so big it doesn't even fit on the counter. Will he offer a larger than life price, or leave the seller singing in the rain?
