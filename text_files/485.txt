Peeping Pawn The Pawn Stars are presented with a supremely rare 1776 Massachusetts penny made by Revolutionary War legend Paul Revere. With only one other coin known to exist in the world, will the gang crank out a mint for this priceless coin or will they find they can't spare the change? Then, Rick has an opportunity to buy a hand grenade made by a top-secret American World War II spy program. Will he pull the pin to make a truly explosive deal or will the negotiations have him running for cover? And later, Rick and Corey meet a man hoping to sell his 1950s peep show machine. Will they like what they see and bare their wallets or will it be too stripped down for comfort?
