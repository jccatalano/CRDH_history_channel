Les is More Get strung along with the Pawn Stars as a 1961 Les Paul SG guitar jams into the shop. Owned by a member of Les Paul's family, will the guys be able to fine-tune their offer, or will the deal de-tune? Then, Rick and the Old Man are presented with a copy of National Geographic from 1969 covering the momentous Apollo 11 moon landing. Will this special issue drag in some moon rock sized profits or will they abort their mission? And later, when Rick brings in a new hire to work the night shift, Chumlee volunteers to help train them into a pawn superstar.
