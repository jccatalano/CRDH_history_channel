Double Your Pawn Giddy up with the Pawn Stars when early Western film star Harry Carey's collection of nearly 200 celebrity autographs lassos into the shop. Will Rick make a bonanza of an offer or ride the deal off into the sunset? Next, a 1900s Wrigley Gum vending machine pops in to the shop. Will Corey double his fun or find it's lost its flavor? Then, a measuring device known as a railroad equilibristat chugs in. Can Rick lay down an offer or will he derail negotiations? And later, a 1960s Jimmy Jet toy zooms in. Will Chum land on a price or will he steer off course?
