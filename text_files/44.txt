Ready, Set, Pawn The Pawn Stars burn up the racetrack when a seller brings in a competition dragster racecar. Can the guys set a new track record and win the deal or will the negotiation stall out and finish last. Then, Rick and Corey are presented with a Japanese land mine training kit used to train American soldiers during World War II. Will the guys detect a good deal or will it all blow up in their face? And later, Corey and Chumlee check out a fully restored 1957 Dr. Pepper vending machine. Will they pop a cold one just like the Dr. ordered or will this soda machine deal go flat?
