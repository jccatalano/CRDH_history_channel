Pawning Reagan Get stumped with the Pawn Stars when a rare double lock musket comes into the shop. Will Rick and Corey take it lock, stock and barrel or will it leave them gun shy? Then, Rick is offered an autographed photo of Laurel & Hardy. Will he make an offer or will a small detail leave him seeing double? And later, when Corey comes face to face with a Ronald Reagan foam head, will he find himself making an offer on the "Gipper"?
