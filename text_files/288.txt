Smokin' Pawn (Enhanced.) Flip a coin with the Pawn Stars when a 1944 steel cent rolls into the shop. Will Rick be a penny pincher or will he call the sale in the air? Next, time is running out when an 1850's calendar clock shows up. Will Rick strike a deal or will it set off an alarm? Then, things get unearthly when a H.R Giger lithograph from the film "Alien 3" creeps in. Will it be a sci-fi success or will Corey send the unidentified object back home? And later, things heat up when a Smokey the Bear puppet blazes in. Will it ignite Chum's fire or will he prevent the deal?
