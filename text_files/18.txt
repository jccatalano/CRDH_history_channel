Xiphos Sword When a group of new bladesmiths enters the forge, they're met with a challenge they never saw coming. They must harvest the steel for their blade from an imposing piece of construction equipment, which proves to be a bigger task than they anticipate. After an intense round of testing and another elimination, the two remaining smiths face off to recreate a classic Greek sword used in close quarters combat. With a $10,000 prize on the line, both smiths turn out impressive blades for a final round of testing, but the judges will choose only one to be crowned Forged in Fire Champion.
