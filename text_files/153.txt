Sica Sword The smiths get locked and loaded to forge a signature blade out of a 50-caliber flintlock pistol. Despite giving it their best shot, it's a struggle turning a gun into a blade and after two grueling rounds two smiths are sent barreling towards elimination. In the final round, the remaining competitors must recreate a lethal gladiator sword, the Sica, and its unique construction poses the final challenge in their attempt to crush the competition and take home the title of Forged In Fire Champion.
