Riders on the Pawn Run in slow motion with the Pawn Stars when a David Hasselhoff signed rescue buoy from the set of "Baywatch" floats in. Will Rick and Chum hassle the Hoff for a deal or will it get cancelled? Then, sparks fly when two flintlock blunderbuss pistols barrel in. Will Rick aim for a deal or will it be a blunder-bust? Next, Rick and Corey get energized while checking out a six person solar bike. Will they amp up the offer or will the seller charge too much? And later, Rick breaks on through to the other side when a yearbook featuring Jim Morrison is brought to the shop. Will he make a deal for the Lizard King or will he graduate without an offer?
