Infantry Weapons (Enhanced; 3-hour episode.) The competition shifts into high gear when the smiths are tasked with turning the rusted steel of a 1971 Mercury Cougar into their signature blade in just three hours. After a grueling round of testing, only two competitors' roads lead them back to their home forge where they have just five days to create an elite military weapon known as the Yatagan. Three is the magic number as our blade smiths are asked to forge three or more metals into a blade of their signature style. Despite pain and failure, two move on to the final round returning home to forge a legendary spiked shield. Then, four of the top bladesmiths from around the globe compete in the first ever Forged In Fire International Championship.
