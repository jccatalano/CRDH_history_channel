A Pawn of Lies Bend your mind with the Pawn Stars when two original lithographs by graphic artist M.C. Escher are brought in. Will Rick make a surreal sale or will he find the deal impossible to construct? Next, things get transparent when a censored recording made on a Soviet X-ray is exposed in the shop. Will Rick throw the seller a bone or will the deal cause a stress fracture? Then, Corey calls shotgun when a Wells Fargo model stagecoach rides in. Will he jump on the bandwagon and make an offer or will he be walking home? And later, a 1950s toy lie detector puts Chum in the hot seat. Will he make an honest offer or will he fail the test?
