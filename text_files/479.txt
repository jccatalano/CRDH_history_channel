The Lion Spear (Enhanced.) Four bladesmiths must figure out how to hack it when they are tasked with crafting a hatchet from pieces of odd shaped steel. After several forging failures, parameter mishaps, and intense conditions -- only two smiths head back to their home forges where they must recreate the deadly Maasai Lion Spear. Who will come out roaring and leave with $10,000 and the pride of becoming a Forged in Fire Champion?
