Masonic Pawn Party like it's 1999 with the Pawn Stars when a hat worn by Prince dances into Rick's hands. Will he be singing for a sale or will it become an unpronounceable flop? Next, an Egyptian scarab ring crawls into the shop. Will Rick think it's sacred or will the deal be covered in dung? Then, a WWII era head shaped grass planter sprouts in. Will it grow on Chum or will he mow over it?
