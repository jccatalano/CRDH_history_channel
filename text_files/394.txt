Death and Taxidermy Get spooked out with the Pawn Stars when a 1547 edition of "The Dance of Death" haunts the shop. Will Rick take the book to his grave or will the negotiation have a bitter end? Next, things get whimsical when two sculptures from Dr. Seuss' unorthodox taxidermy collection are brought in. Will Rick's heart grow two sizes or will he say, "Green eggs and scram"? And later, a tear-gas baton forces its way into the shop. Will Corey think it's a riot or will he be blinded by the price?
