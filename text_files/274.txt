Bow Legged The Pawn Stars are presented with one of most unique items to ever hobble its way into the shop--a pirate's peg leg. Will the gang gather up a sizable bounty for this rare piece of piracy lore, or will they be forced to walk the plank? Then Rick has a chance to buy a brand new, top of the line, archery bow. Can he find the target price with the fiber-optic sights, or will this black bow backfire? And later a man wheels up to the shop with a full size, hand carved, wooden motorcycle. Can the shop widdle down the price or will this deal get axed?
