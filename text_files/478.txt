The Schiavona (Enhanced.) For the first time ever, the bladesmiths begin on a farm where they harvest steel from farming tools, then must use coal forges to make their signature blades with a hidden lanyard hole. Can they keep the fires burning to match the pace of the ticking clock? Ultimately only two smiths return to their home forges to recreate a decorated and deadly Schiavona sword for a chance to claim the title of Forged in Fire Champion.
