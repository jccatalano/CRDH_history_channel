Wilde Card Read between the lines with the Pawn Stars when a first edition of OscarÂ® Wilde's "The Happy Prince" is brought into the shop. Will Rick be able to resist this literary classic or will he yield to temptation? Then, Corey steps into the ring with a 1972 telegram that rejects Muhammad Ali from fighting in Alaska. Will he get ready to rumble for it or will he get knocked out before the negotiation begins? And later, Chumlee bets Rick he can increase his weekly sales by using more casual and cool language. Will he be able to talk the talk or will he be at a loss for words?
