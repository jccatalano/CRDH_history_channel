Ace in the Hole The Pawn Stars hope to capture a glimpse of the Old West when they are presented with an antique professional gambler's toolkit. Complete with every game of the trade and elaborately designed with a secret compartment for trouble, will they up the ante and make an offer or will they be forced to fold? Then, Rick and Corey look to buy rare pieces of 1896 U.S. currency known as the "Educational Series." Lavishly designed by the U.S. Treasury, will the bills receive high praises or will a series of bad reviews send to them back to school? And later, a man hopes to sell his 1950's radiation detecting Geiger counter. Will the shop emit some serious energy for this relic of the Cold War or will the deal force them all to duck and cover?
