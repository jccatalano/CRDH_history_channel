The Kpinga The bladesmiths find the odds stacked against them when they are forced to layer a complex Damascus pattern into their signature style blade. Broken blades and tears fall throughout two challenges and an unforgiving round of testing. In the final round, two smiths are locked in a dead heat to recreate a three-bladed African throwing knife called the Kpinga. Only one will stick the win and be crowned Forged in Fire Champion.
