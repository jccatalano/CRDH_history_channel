Khanda (Enhanced.) The competition piles on as our bladesmiths are asked to forge a weapon in their signature style from a large pile of mixed metal that is welded together. Only two will return home to forge the mysterious Khanda, a legendary blade from ancient India. Will they bend or break under the pressure? That is the question our bladesmiths will face. Only the one left standing will be crowned Forged in Fire Champion.
