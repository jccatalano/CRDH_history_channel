Superfine Econoline Danny makes an old Ford Econoline look so cool that in the end, two buyers get into a bidding war for it. Danny can score big, but only if he can let his baby go. Also, Mike and Roli find a BMW motorcycle with a lot of history, and then stumble upon Mike's dream car in a local's garage.
