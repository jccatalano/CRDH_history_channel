Lost Souls of Pennhurst In 1908 Pennhurst Asylum in eastern Pennsylvania was built to house and care for epileptic, disabled and "feeble-minded" patients, but after a few years Pennhurst became dangerously overcrowded, thanks in large part to the controversial Eugenics movement sweeping the country. As patients flowed in, the staff became overwhelmed. The result was rampant abuse, neglect and horrific conditions. After almost 80 years in operation Pennhurst was finally shut down, thanks to the heroic efforts of a local journalist and a few brave former patients. However, the spirits of the patients and abusive employees still roam the halls of the asylum today, sending chilling messages to visitors and reminding them of the tragic lessons learned during one of the darkest times in American history.
