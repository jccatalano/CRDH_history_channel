Super Smash Bros. Experienced blade smiths, martial artists, and weapons experts bring their custom built blades to a series of grueling challenges that push their skills and their weapons to the limit. Does the Celtiberian Ring Pommel Knife stand a chance against the course? Or will the Medieval Bastard Sword prove its mettle? And can an underdog finally surpass his longtime blade-sport opponent? The top two competitors advance to take on the punishing final course -- "Dead Run." Only one will earn a spot in the grand finale with a chance to be crowned Knife or Death Champion and take home the $20,000 prize.
