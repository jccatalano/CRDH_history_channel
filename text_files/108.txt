Pawn Fiction You never can tell with the Pawn Stars when a cast jacket from Pulp Fiction dances into the shop. Can Rick walk the path of the righteous man for this piece of movie memorabilia or will it end in uncomfortable silence? Then, Corey goes solo when opera gloves signed by Hollywood legend Clark Gable are brought in. Will he be able to hit the right note with this deal or will the fat lady sing? And later, Rick heads to well-known Las Vegas legend Lonnie Hammargren's home to check out his collection of unique items. Will Rick hit the jackpot or will this treasure hunt turn into a wild goose chase?
