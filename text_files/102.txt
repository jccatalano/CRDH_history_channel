Kings and McQueens The Pawn Stars are blown away when a seller limps in with a 19th century shotgun disguised as a cane. Will Rick take a shot at buying this legendary concealed firearm or will his offer miss the mark? Then, Rick and Chumlee race to check out a 1940 Indian Motorcycle once owned by the King of Cool, Steve McQueen. Will this negotiation take off like a Bullitt or will Rick let this one make a Great Escape? And later, the guys are presented with a book printed by founding father Benjamin Franklin. Will Rick shell out some of his own Benjamins for this rare piece or will he find it's not worth the paper it's printed on?
