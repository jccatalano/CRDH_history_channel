Capture the Pawn Prepare for battle with the Pawn Stars when a rare 1589 book with the instructions for war and fortification guards the shop. Will Rick reinforce a good price or will he protect his wallet? Next, the game is on when Rick checks out an 1840s chess table. Will he capture the sale or will it be a draw? Then, a sale comes a calling when a pair of antique door knockers enter the shop. Will Corey welcome the deal or will he show them the exit? And later, an 1800s experimental rifle holds up the shop. Will Rick and Chum test out an offer or will they fail to fire?
