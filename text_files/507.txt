The Happiest Place to Pawn Rick and Corey are inspired by an anti-war speech signed by Dr. Martin Luther King. Will they "sit in" or sit this one out? A remote-controlled miniature version of a boat from Disney's Jungle Cruise ride has Rick and Chum navigating a tough deal. Rick pins his hopes on a German "Blue Max" medal from WWI, but can he honor the seller's high asking price? Later, in an interesting development, an antique Nikon camera from the 1950s makes a flashy appearance. Will Chum snap it up or shutter himself off?
