Katrina Cannibal New Orleans, Louisiana has a storied spiritual history, and is considered by many to be the most haunted city in America. In August of 2005 a tragic event occurred that would change the city forever--Hurricane Katrina. But how did this affect the spirit world? One local couple would soon find out. Zack Bowen and Addie Hall decided to remain as "holdouts" in the French Quarter. Then, in October of 2006, Zack committed suicide by jumping from the top floor of a local hotel, just a little more than a week after he committed a heinous and shocking act: he strangled his Addie and dismembered her corpse. The crime sent shockwaves through New Orleans as the locals searched for answers. Did Zack's experience in the Iraq War years before cause him to do the unthinkable? Or, as some locals speculate, was Zack the victim of a demonic possession brought on during the aftermath of Katrina...creating the perfect storm of hungry spirits and vulnerable prey?
