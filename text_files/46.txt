Buffalo Bull The Pawn Stars hope to win by a landslide when President Ronald Reagan's high school yearbook comes into the shop. Complete with a signed letter from The Gipper, will the guys make an executive decision to buy this presidential memorabilia, or will a tough negotiation force them to veto? Then, a man comes in hoping to sell some puppets and props from the original Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. Tied to an obscure performer named Buffalo Ben, will Rick pony up some cash for this collection, or will he send it out to pasture? And later, Rick and the Old Man get a call to check out a vintage phone booth. Will they try to dial up a deal for this piece of telephone history, or drop the call before negotiations begin?
