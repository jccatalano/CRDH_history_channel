Tabar Four bladesmiths must take an ordinary garden lawnmower and using its metal to bend and shape to their will, create one of their signature blades. When the other contestants are mowed down in the competition, two will make it to the final round where they must create a Tabar, a deadly battle axe from Southern Asia. After a series of grueling tests, only one will survive the cut to be named the Forged in Fire champion.
