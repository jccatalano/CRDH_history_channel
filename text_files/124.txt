Lock Stock and Two Nickel Barrels Hit "The Big Trail" with the Pawn Stars when Rick gets offered a rare movie poster for John Wayne's first film. Will the asking price scare Rick off, or will he saddle up anyway? Then, a vintage RC helicopter strikes Rick's fancy. Will their negotiation take flight, or will this deal stay grounded? And later, Chum takes a shot at a couple of nickel plated pistols supposedly made by the most famous gunmaker of the victorian era. Will he meet the seller's high asking price, or stick to his guns and prepare for a negotiating duel?
