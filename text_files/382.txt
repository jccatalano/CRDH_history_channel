The Horseman's Axe (Enhanced.) Four bladesmiths are pushed to their limits when they each must forge a signature blade from small springs of steel. Wonky welds and broken billets cause major setbacks that must be corrected before the time runs out. Ultimately, two smiths manage to turn their setbacks into comebacks to secure a spot in the final round where they must recreate the deadly Horseman's Axe. Which smith will join the ranks of Forged In Fire champions and return home with the $10,000 prize?
