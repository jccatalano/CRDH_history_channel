Ancient Special Forces Discover the ancient Roman navy SEAL technique of capturing enemy ships from underwater and replicate the feat with a champion free-diver who will work with ancient tools underwater on one breath for six minutes. We attempt to solve one of History's greatest mysteries, the tactics of ancient Roman war dog units; we meet a historically savage breed of dog--the Mastiff--that may have been used on the battlefields of antiquity. Learn the secrets of the samurai sword--how it was made and how it became the most legendary blade in History. Finally, we build and test an ancient Horro--a Japanese device that could protect a galloping cavalryman from arrow fire, yet was only made from a billowing layer of thin silk.
