Alien Weapons (Enhanced; 4-hour episode.) Throughout history, advances in technology have led to the development of powerful weapons--each more deadly than the last. But were these lethal weapons the product of human innovation--or were they created with help from another, otherworldly source? Might the United States military really have a secret space program? And if so, are we preparing for a space-based war with other nations... or other species? New discoveries of metals once thought to be mythological. Mysterious metal spheres defying the laws of physics. Could these out of place artifacts be physical evidence of extraterrestrials visiting planet Earth in the distant past, leaving behind remnants of their technology? In nearly every culture there are stories of opposing forces at work here on Earth--forces of a supernatural or otherworldly nature. Could these forces really exist? And if so, what is the true nature of the dark forces?
