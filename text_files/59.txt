Dollars & Dunks Shoot some hoops with the Pawn Stars when Rick checks out a warm-up jersey signed by The Black Mamba himself: Kobe Bryant. Will he make a slam dunk on a sale or buy nothing but air? Then, Rick has an axe to grind over a seller's asking price for an antique weapon and Corey might be Leaving Las Vegas when he makes an impulse buy on his favorite book. Later, Rick and Chumlee will either raise a glass for an old-timey toaster or get burnt on a no sale.
