Can't Pawn Me Love Rick travels to an art gallery in the Venetian Hotel to see some monstrously expensive illustrations from the classic children's book, "Where the Wild Things Are." Back at the shop, a collection of ultra-rare Beatles vinyl records sends Chum across the universe. Can he work it out with the seller, or will he decide to let it be? Chum warms his buns with an antique hot dog bun warmer, while Rick is frank about an electric hot dog cooker. Later, Rick and Chum can only hope to force the sale of a Princess Leia action figure signed by the late Carrie Fisher.
