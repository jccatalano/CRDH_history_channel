The King's Bling The Pawn Stars are presented with a necklace once owned by the King of Rock and Roll himself, Elvis Presley. Made of an entire pound of gold, will Rick get all shook up with excitement, or is the King's chain just an impersonator? Then, a guy brings in a collection of over 200 vintage Matchbox cars from the 50's, 60's and 70's. With the seller hoping to pawn them for a big loan, will the guys bank on the value of these toys, or will they worry about collateral damage? And later, a man comes in with a pair of German Pickelhauben helmets from World War I. Sporting traditional Prussian spikes on top, can these rare helmets draw Rick onto the negotiation battlefield? Or will he be too hard-headed to make an offer?
