Wake Island: The Alamo of the Pacific It's a story of survival on a desert island--and it helped change the course of WWII! Within hours of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, about 1,600 US marines and civilians found themselves under surprise attack from Japan on a tiny Pacific Island. In a 2-hour special, we take six survivors of the siege of Wake Island back to the scene of their heroic stand. They retrace those horrific days in which they suffered eventual capture, beatings, and imprisonment--yet survived to tell their stories.
