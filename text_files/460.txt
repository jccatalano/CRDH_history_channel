You Betcha With a massive property and a motivated seller, the guys pick Kentucky's Pioneer Playhouse where a mysterious wooden box captures Mike's attention. Frank is sure it's a magic box but Mike disagrees, leading to a serious wager. With rusty gold as far as the eye can see, Pete reveals his most valuable items are buried underground. And a random stop at a South Carolina service station pays off with a rare oil sign and a 1950s zombie relic. Later, an appraiser identifies the mystery box.
