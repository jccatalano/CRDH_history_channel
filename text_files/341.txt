WWII Pawn (Enhanced; 2-hour episode.) The Pawn Stars dive right in with a folding bike used by paratroopers during WWII. Will they stick the landing or collapse under pressure? There's an air of betrayal at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop when an super rare ancient Roman "Ides of March" coin comes into the shop. Then, a seller with a Bible from the 1500s tries to make a believer out of Corey, but his go-to book expert warns him to beware of false profits. The Gold & Silver turns into the happiest place on earth when a seller brings in some vintage Disneyland employee costumes.
