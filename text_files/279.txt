Unprankable The Pawn Stars prepare for a duel when a check signed by Aaron Burr comes in the shop. Will Rick try to turn this check into cash, or will a tough negotiation make the seller bounce? Then, Rick and Corey check out a 1960 Chevy Corvair. Will the guys have the guts to take this car, once considered "Unsafe at Any Speed," out for a spin? And later, Corey is determined to pay Chumlee back for a prank gone awry. Can he pull one over on the self-proclaimed "Prank Master?"
