Rick's Bad Day The Pawn Stars have an opportunity to buy a theater playbill from the night that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. But first they'll have to determine it's authenticity. Then Corey and Chum meet a modern day renaissance man and buy his pair of Halbert spears. But before they can put their tights on, the Old Man suspects there may be more there than meets the eye. And later, Rick takes a gamble on an elegant, perpetual motion clock that he hopes will stand the test of time.
