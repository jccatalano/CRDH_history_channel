A Fish Called Lifeline Expert bladesmiths, martial artists, and a competition cutting champion bring their best edged-weapons to chop, stab, and slice through an exhausting set of challenges built to push blades and blade-wielding skills to the limit. Can the curved Egyptian Khopesh take a competitor straight to victory? Or will the Viking Seax put the other blades to shame? And whose weapon will fail before they can even take their first swing? Only the top two competitors will face off on the grueling final course - "Dead Run." The last blade left standing will have a chance to be crowned Knife or Death Champion and win the $20,000 grand prize.
