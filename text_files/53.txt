Road Test Travel back in time with the Pawn Stars when a guitar that belonged to The Who's bassist, John Entwistle, strikes a chord with Rick. Will his nostalgia for the band cause him to shell out big bucks for a piece of his "generation" or will he not "get fooled again"? Then, Rick and Lili get the presidential treatment when a customer brings in a Richard Nixon paper dress. Will this campaign outfit dress to impress, or wear out its welcome? And later, the guys decide it's time to put the Old Man's driving skills to the test. Can he prove to them once and for all that he's the king of the road, or will his license to ride expire?
