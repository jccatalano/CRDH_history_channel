Ultimate Team Challenge The heat is doubled as four master smiths compete alongside their apprentices to forge an iconic weapon of warfare--the trench knife. Each team must work together, tagging in and out every half hour, with only one smith allowed to touch the knife at a time. Blood is spilled and tears are shed. Refusing to retreat, two teams square off in one final battle to recreate a blade that's stood the test of time--the Chinese Dao Sword. Which team will emerge from the trenches triumphant and claim victory as the next Forged in Fire Champions?
