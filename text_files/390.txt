Daddy's Girl Get tagged with the Pawn Stars when artwork from graffiti sensation Keith Haring comes into the shop. Will this street art draw Rick's attention or will he not get the picture?

And later, when Rick takes his daughter car shopping, he's forced to deal with used car salesman--and shop regular--Davey. Can Rick steer clear of a bad buy or will he get stuck with a lemon?
