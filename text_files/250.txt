Viking Sword Four bladesmiths are subjected to one of the most extreme challenges of the season when they must salvage material from a car and forge a blade in a race against time. Only two will speed through to the final round where they'll have five days to create a Viking sword. In a shocking finale they are pushed to their limits but only one can be crowned the Forged in Fire champion.
