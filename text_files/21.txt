Ngombe Ngulu Four blade smiths enter the forge and are given the twisted challenge of having to forge blades from a giant elevator cable. Which smiths will unravel after two challenges and a brutal round of testing? Only two will return home to recreate the African Ngombe Ngulu, known as the executions sword. In the final round the smiths are neck and neck in the testing. Who will keep their head and be crowned the Forged in Fire Champion and the winner of 10,000 dollars?
