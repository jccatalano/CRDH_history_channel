Spare the Rodman The Pawn Stars get a fast break when the ex-wife of NBA star Dennis Rodman drops by. Trying to sell a collection of Rodman's signed jerseys, will the guys jump at the chance to own a piece of sports history, or will heightened emotions cause them to foul out? Then, Rick and Chumlee prepare to flee when they're presented with a jury questionnaire from the O.J. Simpson trial. Do they vote unanimously to buy, or is the jury still out? And later, a BMC pedal tractor from the 1950s plows into the shop. Will the guys make hay while the sun shines, or put this relic out to pasture?
