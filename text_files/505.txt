Gilded Pawn Age All aboard with the Pawn Stars when Rick checks out a Gilded Age train. Will he be able to hook up a buyer for this thing, or is Rick holding a one-way ticket to No Sale? Then, a classic Nintendo race car game from the 1960s rolls its way into the shop. Will Corey and Chum hit the brakes on a sale or will they cross the finish line? Also, Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's an amazing Superman and Batman print. Will it save the day and become a sale or will the heroes be defeated?
