Learning the Ropes The Pawn Stars are back in school when a first edition of Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" comes into the shop. Will the guys be on the same page about this novel's value, or will the seller throw the book at them? Then, Corey focuses his sights on a 19th century rope gun. Used on ships to shoot ropes a long distance, will he try to tie this one up, or is it knot a good deal? And later, Corey and Chum conduct interviews to find the shop's newest night shift broker. Can they sift through the candidates to find a diamond in the rough, or will they bring Rick a bag full of fool's gold?
