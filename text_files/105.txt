Woah Pilgrim Put up your dukes with the Pawn Stars when the guys are offered the hat John Wayne wore in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." Will they negotiate with guns blazing, or send the seller riding off into the sunset? Then, Chumlee puts on his best poker face when he checks out a card playing book from 1866. Is the deck stacked in Chumlee's favor, or is he drawing dead? And later, when Corey brings his dog to the shop for the day, the guys try to put her to work.
