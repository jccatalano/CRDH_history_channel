Locked Up and Rail Roaded Burn rubber with the Pawn Stars when they test drive a 1950s Chrysler Town & Country Newport. Will Corey drive a hard bargain or lack the horsepower? Next, a cubist painting by New Zealand artist Louise Henderson brushes in to the shop. Will Rick get a square deal or will he paint himself into a corner? Then, antique railroad locks from the late 1800s clasp their way in. Will they secure a place in Rick's heart or will he ride them out of town? And later, an early-1900s self-heating gasoline iron steams in. Will it smooth things out with Chum or leave him hot under the collar?
