Blades of Deal Rick drives up to a 1984 Ferrari 308 that he hopes to drive off with. Can he accelerate a deal, or will the high asking price throttle negotiations? Corey is all ears when a seller brings in a phone-operated music player from the 1930s. Rick throws his hat into the ring for a cowboy hat owned by Larry Hagman of the TV shows "Dallas" and "I Dream of Jeannie."
