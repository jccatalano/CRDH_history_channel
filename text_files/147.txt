The Last Samurai In this new series hosted by Bill Goldberg, America's top bladesmiths, martial artists, and weapons experts face off in the most extreme knife competition ever created. With hand-forged, custom-made, and historical blades, each competitor must stab, slice, and chop through a grueling gauntlet of challenges designed to test their blades and their blade-wielding skills. Will the age-old Samurai technique carry one competitor to victory? Will the ancient Kopis sword survive the course? Or will America's historical Bowie knife prevail? The final two competitors will go head to head on the daunting final course -- "Dead Run." Who will advance for the chance to win the $20,000 grand prize and be crowned Knife or Death Champion?
