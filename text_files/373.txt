Naughty Nomad When a client rolls into Count's Kustoms with a beautiful 1955 Chevy Nomad, Danny can't help but want the car for his collection. While the owner wants a simple paint job Danny and Ryan have a hard time doing simple. They take a chance and decide to surprise the client with some Count's Kustoms style pin striping. Danny figures the Nomad's owner doesn't like how it turns out, he might just sell it! Meanwhile, Mike and Shannon find 1972 Nova in desperate need of an overhaul. Then Ryan and Shannon check out a rare Harley-Davidson dirt bike.
