Brew Master Risk it all with the Pawn Stars when a medal believed to be a Polish White Eagle soars into the shop. With no time to call an expert, Rick must decide whether to go all in or sit this one out. Then, Corey and Chumlee race to check out a brick from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Chum knows he can lead Rick to beer, but can he make him drink?
