Some Serious Coinage The first American coin ever made has Rick thinking this is a sale that was mint to be--but it'll cost him a serious chunk of change. Corey and Chum see a future for an antique "Jetsons" cartoon lunchbox that zooms across their counter. Can they draw on their negotiating skills and make a deal? A hood ornament from an Austrian automaker pulls into the shop, but will it drive Rick to make an offer? Later, Rick gets some self-help, medieval style, from an ancient Latin book.
