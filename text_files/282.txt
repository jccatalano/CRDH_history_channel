Fiesta Loco Paint the town red with the Pawn Stars when a Monet landscape brushes into the shop. Will the artwork make a bad impression on Rick or will this picture be worth a million dollars? Then, Corey feels the heat when a customer brings in an old firefighter station. Can he douse this customer's expectations or will he get burned? And later, when Rick's history lesson on Cinco de Mayo drives the guys loco, Rick may be uninvited to his own fiesta.
