Going Postal Make money with the Pawn Stars as they are presented with a one of a kind U.S. postage printing plate from 1862. Will the guys trek through rain or heat or gloom of night to make a deal or will they return this one to sender? Then, a guy comes in with a rare recording of a speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Made just months before his assassination, will Rick stand strong and buy this American icon's recording or will the tiniest scratch make it all worth skipping? And later, Rick and Chumlee encounter a Star Wars collector's dream, a recalled poster for Return of the Jedi. Will Rick use the force and battle for this holy grail of galactic memorabilia or will a tough negotiation have him retreating to a galaxy far far away?
