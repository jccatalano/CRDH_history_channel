The Shotel (Enhanced.) Four bladesmiths face the unpredictable challenge of taking high carbon steel and wrought iron and forging these two conflicting materials into a fully functional weapon. After a formidable round of testing, only two will move on to the final round where they'll have just five days to create one of the most beautifully designed blades in history, the Ethiopian Shotel. Will this uniquely shaped blade throw them a curveball or will one be able to hook themselves the title of Forged in Fire champion?
