The Chum System Come to attention with the Pawn Stars when a nightstick believed to be owned by Ulysses S. Grant gets presented to the shop. Will this piece of military memorabilia be a hit or will Rick break off the deal? Then, Corey and Chum roll in to check out a collection of vintage skateboard stickers. Will the guys get stuck on the price or will they do a 180? And later, Chumlee tries to prove to Rick he is a multitasking master. Can he successfully kill two birds with one stone or will he end up getting nothing done?
