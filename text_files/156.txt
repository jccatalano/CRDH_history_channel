Last Action Hero In the epic season finale, the bladesmiths, martial artists, and knife thrower who survived the intimidating course are back to prove their skills in the winner-take-all final showdown. This time their blades will have to be twice as fierce to endure the bigger, badder, and tougher challenges they'll face. Will it be a Kukri that ends up a cut above? Can the Medieval Longsword outlast the rest? Or will the classic Chopper cut all the others down to size? The fastest two will go head to head on the souped-up grand finale "Dead Run" course. And only one can be left standing as the first Knife or Death Champion and take home the $20,000 grand prize.
