Pawn Another Day Strike a pose with the Pawn Stars when Madonna's 1988 day planner vogues into the shop. Will it make Corey a material guy or will he fail to get into the groove? Next, a 1910 phrenology head analyzes its way in. Will it get a good read on Chum or will the deal hit some bumps? Then, an 1800s locket with preacher Henry Ward Beecher closes in. Will Rick give it his blessing or condemn it? And later, a 1980s egg chair used for hearing tests cranks up the volume. Will Corey hear money or think it's an unsound buy?
