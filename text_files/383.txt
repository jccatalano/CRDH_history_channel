The Moro Kris The bladesmiths must forge a signature weapon using everyday steel objects like ball bearings and shovels as their only source material. One contestant puts finishing his weapon before his own safety in a heated race to the finish. Only two competitors will move on and are given just five days to forge the mystical Moro Kris Sword--a distinctive blade that dates all the way back to 300 BC.
