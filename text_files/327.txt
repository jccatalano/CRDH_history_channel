Over the Top Run for cover with the Pawn Stars when a World War I helmet blasts into the shop. The first metal helmet used by U.S. forces, will the guys butt heads to buy this piece or will they dig in for a long negotiation? Then, Corey and Rick are presented with a gun holster used on the long running TV show Gunsmoke. Will they round up a posse and go after this prop with guns blazing or are they just blowing smoke? And later, Rick decides the guys could use some exercise and hires them a personal trainer. Can he convince these couch potatoes to "feel the burn" or will they decide there's no gain to pain?
