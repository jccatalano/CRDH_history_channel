The Scottish Claymore Four blade smiths face one of the most grueling challenges in Forged in Fire history when the electricity and power tools are taken away from them and they must forge a blade with just fire and their bare hands. Only two will survive this strenuous task to move on to the final round where they'll have just five days to create the iconic Scottish Claymore, the legendary weapon of William Wallace. They'll go blade to blade in a final round of testing, but only the bravest of hearts will be crowned the Forged in Fire champion.
