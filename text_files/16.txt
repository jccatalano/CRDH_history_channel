Viking Edition Four brave competitors march into a dry moat where they must resurrect old swords and forge them into a Viking Seax, using the time-tested coal forge. With hammers in full swing and multiple obstacles in their path, the smiths exhaust every ounce of their strength to produce weapons fit to withstand any test imaginable. In the final challenge, the remaining two smiths voyage home to recreate a pair of deadly Viking War Axes in their final fight for the coveted title of Forged In Fire champion.
