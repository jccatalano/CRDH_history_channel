All the Barong Moves Bladesmiths, martial arts experts, and even a butcher must use their custom made, historical weapons to slice, stab, and chop their way through a series of punishing challenges built to test weapons and competitors alike. Can an elite knife thrower hold onto his Nepalese Kukri and out wield his competition? Will the course overwhelm a 100-year-old Barong? Or will the hand-forged Falcata come out on top? The top two competitors will advance to face the ultimate final course -- "Dead Run." Only one will have a chance to win the $20,000 grand prize and be crowned Knife or Death Champion.
