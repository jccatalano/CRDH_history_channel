Duck and Hover Rick and Mike make like 007 when they float over land and lake on a one-man hovercraft about to go on the block. But will this blow away the crowd when it comes time to sell--or will Rick's pitch be seen as just a lot of hot air? Then, Rick's own money is on the line when he buys a trio of abandoned storage units. Are there big dollars buried in all that stuff, or just the leftovers of a lifetime? And when Jerry brings in a pair of lifelike--and life-sized--dinosaur statues, Rick and Mike take the primordial pair on a crazy tour of the lake to dig up some BIG bids.
