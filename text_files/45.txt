Backroom Brawl The Pawn Stars are presented with a mysterious pocket-sized sundial believed to be from the 16th Century...complete with a concealed secret inside. Will the gang be able to shine a light on this puzzling piece of history, or will the seller darken their day by shooting for the moon? Rick and the Old Man have a chance to buy a photo album of famed union organizer Jimmy Hoffa. Will they wheel up a deal for this item, or will it be sent back to be hidden and buried away for ever? Then later Corey and Chumlee set their sights on a rifle sharpshooting arcade game from the 60's. Will Corey target a good price for this vintage game, or will his plan backfire?
