Honoring Our Veterans (Enhanced; 4-hour episode.) In Chicago, Mike and Frank find a massive warehouse filled with cast off treasures including some superstar sports memorabilia that are a total slam dunk. In Detroit, Mike acquires a Purple Heart along with a very special mission. The guys have their work cut out for them on a huge property with more custom '32 Fords than they have ever seen in one place, and Danielle attempts an important military mission. Then, the guys explore a stash of ultra-rare motorcycle parts found behind a secret wall, and they find the ultimate aviation collectible -- a propeller linked to Charles Lindbergh.
