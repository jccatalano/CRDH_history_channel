Midwest Picking (Enhanced; 3-hour episode.) Mike and Frank accept a special invite from Indiana's Model-A Ford lady and fall hard for her ultra-rare barn-fresh Model-A tow truck. Next, Mike and Frank visit a hot rod mechanic with a super expensive collection of rare bubbletop cars. Then, a junkyard wizard has an Oktoberfest gem with Frank Fritz's name written all over it.
