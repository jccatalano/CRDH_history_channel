The Other Nostradamus. He predicted WWII, the deaths of US Presidents, and the turmoil of the 1960s. He prophesied that Israel would become a state 15 years before the event and foretold the Great Depression. Many of his visions seemed to pass unfulfilled, but are now proven accurate. His name is Edgar Cayce, and to many, he's known as the other Nostradamus. Throughout the 1930s and '40s, Cayce was a well-known American figure, reputed for his "healing abilities" as well as his prophecies. Cayce's predictions are documented in the transcriptions of his readings, which he gave until his death in 1945. Join us as we examine his life and prophecies.
