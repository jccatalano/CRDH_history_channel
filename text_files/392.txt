Pawn of Fire Walk the line with the Pawn Stars when a model train once owned by Johnny Cash chugs into the shop. Will Rick make a bid for the Man in Black or will he be singing the prison blues? Then, Chum gets scrambled when a 1920's chicken incubator clucks on in. Will Chum hatch a deal or will it get poached? Next, Rick becomes enlightened while checking out a 17th century Tibetan Buddha. Will he be reborn as a buyer or take a vow of silence? And later, Rick and Corey take a trip down memory lane in a 1972 Cadillac Eldorado. Will the guys take home the luxury Caddy or will it turn out to be a clunker?
