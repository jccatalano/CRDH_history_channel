Breaking the Bank The Pawn Stars take it to the hoop when one of NBA legend Dr. J's supposed game-worn sneakers steps into the shop. Will the guys score a slam dunk on this item or will it be an air ball? Then, a rare Half Eagle coin from the Civil War flies in. Can the guys land this Eagle or will it fly away? And later, when everyone borrows from Rick's coin jar, will he see it's time to change or will the guys break his bank?
