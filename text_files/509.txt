Enemy Territory Before any enemy can be destroyed, it first has to be found. Reconnaissance is one of the SEALs' many areas of expertise. Their training includes extreme stealth, camouflage tactics and most importantly, operating on their own in hostile environments. SEAL SR teams remain invisible while gathering Intel on the target--then strike with lethal force when the moment is right. While the main purpose of reconnaissance is to hide and watch, SEAL history has shown this mission can turn deadly in an instant.
