Looney Dunes The Pawn Stars pray to the rock gods when a collection of unpublished photos of Jimi Hendrix blasts into the shop. Taken by Jimi's personal photographer, will Rick be able to contain his excitement and make a deal, or will he tip his hand and see the signal go from green to red? Then, the guys see history repeat itself when they check out two high-performance dune buggies in the same day. Will they jump at a chance to buy these tricked out toys, or will both deals sputter out when negotiations get stuck in the sand? And later, Rick and the Old Man check out a rare 1930's Levi's jacket. Will Rick be busting at the seams to snatch up this highly sought after denim, or is this old piece just not a good fit?
