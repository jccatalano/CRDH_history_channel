Prophecies of Israel The Tanakh of the Jews is an acronym that identifies the Hebrew Bible, equivalent to the Old Testament to Christians. Within the 24 books of the Tanakh (or Mikra as it was called during the period of its recording) are astounding predictions of the future. Many of the prophets who authored or appeared in the scriptures prophesied about the fate of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. We'll examine the prophecies and chronicle the birth, death, recent resurrection, and possible future of Israel. Supported by archival footage and dramatic recreations, on-camera experts representing the three major religions, and secular perspectives, we explore the most significant of these ancient prophecies. Are the prophecies real? Are they unfolding before our eyes? Who believes, who doesn't, and why?
