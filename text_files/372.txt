Caddylicious Danny and the team take on a 1967 Caddy for a high end client, but will Ryan and Danny's plan to match the unique interior with a root beer paint job fly, or fizzle? Danny's old friend, Jeff Blando of the band Slaughter, stops by the shop to get the finishing touch on a Rock and Roll themed chopper that Danny built for him years ago. Meanwhile, Ryan and Roli spot a Buick Skylark with a Hollywood history.
