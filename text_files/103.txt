What You Talkin' Bout Sturgis It's the surprise of a lifetime, when the Pawn Stars give Chumlee a customized Harley-Davidson FXR for his 30th birthday. Will he join them on their trip to the motorcycle rally in Sturgis, or faint from the shock? Then, Rick and the Old Man look at a collection of original blueprints from the U.S.S. Maine. A battleship whose sinking led to the Spanish-American War, do the guys score a direct hit with these rare drawings? Then, Rick is spinning over a wooden 1940s airplane propeller. Hand-carved by master propeller maker Ole Fahlin, will negotiations go sky-high, or never even get off the ground?
