Knights Templar Four brave smiths are thrown for a loop when they must forge together rusty chain mail and high quality steel to produce Knights Templar Crusader Daggers in Round 1. The competitors must strategically battle their greatest enemy- the ticking clock- to ensure these double-edged medieval blades are fit to withstand brutal testing. Two smiths survive elimination and are sent back to their home forges on a five day quest to recreate the iconic Knights Templar Crusader Sword. After a punishing round of tests, only one contender slays the competition and is knighted the next Forged in Fire Champion.
