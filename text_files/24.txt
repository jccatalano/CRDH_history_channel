The Kukri Monster America's top blade smiths, martial artists, and even a stuntman bring their hand-made, historical weapons to chop, slice, and stab through taxing challenges that test their skills and blades. Can one competitor show that his antique Barong was made to last? Will a Kukri/Bowie hybrid prove that two blade styles are better than one? Will the season's youngest bladesmith surprise or get cut down? The final two competitors will face off on the dreaded final course -- "Dead Run." Only one moves on to the grand finale for the chance to win $20,000 and be crowned Knife or Death Champion.
