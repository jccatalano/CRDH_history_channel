Case Closed Help the Pawn Stars solve the crime of the century when a man brings in a detective's case file from the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping. Will these 79-year-old forensic files contain a hot lead or is this cold case unsolvable? Then, Rick and Chumlee stare down the barrel of a 17th century gun believed to be a musketoon. A shorter version of a musket used by sailors and pirates, will this gun's history shoot the price up or will the negotiation misfire? And later, a 1974 Lotus Europa sports car rolls up to the shop. Can Rick rev up a deal for this ultra sweet ride or will he push it into the red and blow the deal?
