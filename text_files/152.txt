The Kachin Dao This competition isn't smooth sailing as the four bladesmiths must use steel from old nautical equipment to forge weld their signature blade, while being forced to do it using a metal inlay technique. After two turbulent rounds, two smiths propel to the final round where they have just five days to forge the Kachin Dao, a deadly headhunting sword. It's sink or swim as only one can rise above the tide to be named the Forged in Fire Champion.
