Pawn Patent Space out with Pawn Stars when an autograph of astronomer Edwin Hubble takes a starring role. Will Rick hitch his wagon to this star or keep his feet on the ground? Next, an 1850s patent model self-lighting and extinguishing lantern flashes into the shop. Will Rick light up an offer or will the deal go dark? Then, a Starrett Food Chopper slices in. Will Corey dice up an offer or will he get cut? And later, an 1871 British Martini-Henry Short Lever Rifle bores into the shop. Will Rick shoot off a deal or will he misfire?
