Crosby, Stills and Cash The Pawn Stars are blown away when a pair of WWII bomb fins drop into the shop. Designed to keep bombs on target, will the guys try to blast out a deal for these rare military items, or will they run for cover as the negotiation implodes? Then, Rick tries to get in tune with a guy who brings in a Martin guitar signed by 60's super group Crosby, Stills and Nash. Will Rick's offer be music to the seller's ears, or will he get nothing but feedback? And later, the guys continue their daunting search for a new employee to work the night shift. Will they pick beauty over brains or go with a safe bet?
