Broadsiding Lincoln The hunt is on when the Pawn Stars are presented with one of the most sought after items in American history, a John Wilkes Booth Wanted Poster. Will this priceless piece give them the slip or is Rick determined to bring it in dead or alive? Then, a guy buzzes the shop with a fighter pilot's G-Suit. Designed to prevent pilots from passing out, will the guys lock their radar onto this item or will a tough negotiation leave them feeling woozy? And later, Rick is flashed a Police badge from 1930s Al Capone controlled Chicago. Will Rick follow the strict letter of the law to make a deal or will the seller need some extra "convincing?"
