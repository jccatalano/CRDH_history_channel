Crossing Chum Get rewarded with the Pawn Stars when a 1965 Panama Canal service medal is presented to the shop. Will Rick keep his eyes on the prize or will he fail to complete his mission? Then, Corey sets his sights on a renaissance era crossbow. Will Corey hit a bulls eye or miss his target entirely? And later, Chumlee finds himself in hot water after he fails to call in an expert. Will his wacky sale turn a profit or will the joke be on him?
