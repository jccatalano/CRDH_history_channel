Rocky Road Come out fighting with the Pawn Stars when handprints signed by Sylvester Stallone pummels into the shop. Will Rick score a knockout deal, or go down a Rocky road? Then, Rick scouts out two signed Norman Rockwell lithographs. Titled "Puppy Love" and "Dressing Up", will they be picture perfect, or show their true colors? And later, Chumlee tries to prove he is more active than everyone thinks he is by entering an arm-wrestling competition. Will Chum muscle his way to a win or will he be strong armed out of the competition?
