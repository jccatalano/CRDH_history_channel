Tommy Lee's Chopper When Tommy Lee's beloved bike gets crushed in an accident, he turns to the only person he trusts to fix it--the guys who built it--Count's Kustoms. Danny and Ryan take in a cool collection to cheer them up after seeing Tommy's smashed bike. Then after lots of tender loving care, Danny heads to LA, to bring Tommy his baby back.
