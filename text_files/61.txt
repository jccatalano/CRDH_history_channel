Ultimate Fighting Pawn A seller brings in an antique high wheel bike that's off the chain. Will Rick think these wheels are a steal, or will he tire of this bike? Chum gets the sharp end of the stick when he sells one of Rick's prized Japanese katanas to UFC President Dana White. Rick leaves the pawn shop to score a gorgeously-restored grand piano from the 1800s. Will it hit all the right notes, or will he Bach out of the sale? Later, Rick jams out to an original Walkman cassette player. Will he fast forward to a sale, or hit the pause button?
