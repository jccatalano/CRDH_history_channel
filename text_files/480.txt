The Kelewang The bladesmiths must make their signature blades out of only drill bits and a chunk of mild steel, but untwisting the bits and combining the two steels proves almost impossible. After two rounds, only two smiths survive the chopping block and are sent back to their home forges to recreate a beautiful, but deadly Indonesian sword -- the Kelewang. A final round of testing proves that victory lies at the junction between form and function, as one bladesmith's Kelewang earns him $10,000 and the title of Forged in Fire Champion.
