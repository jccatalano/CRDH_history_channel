The Haladie (Enhanced.) For the first time ever, four bladesmiths must use high carbon steel to forge a hatchet. After an intense round of testing, only two can chop their way to the final round where they'll have just five days to create an ancient Indian weapon used to both stab and slice. Will the double-edged Haladie wound both of the finalists, or can one be singled out and crowned Forged in Fire champion?
