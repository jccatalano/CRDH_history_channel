Corey's Big Play Take a ride with the Pawn Stars when they check out a 1924 Dodge Brothers sedan. Complete with the original wooden wheels, will the guys make a move for this piece of automotive history, or will a questionable restoration have them dodging the deal? Then, a guy drags in a 19th century ball and chain that's inside a Wells Fargo strongbox. Will Rick be able to put these rare pieces on lockdown, or will he get distracted and let them slip away? And later, Corey and Chumlee check out a Terminator "skill stop" slot machine. Will the guys save the future by defeating this terminator, or is this killer robot more than they can handle?
